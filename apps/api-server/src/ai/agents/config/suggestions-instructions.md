# Suggestion Generation Instructions

Generate 3-5 relevant follow-up suggestions based on the conversation context.

## Guidelines
1. Suggestions should be actionable and specific
2. Consider the user's recent queries and interests
3. Offer a mix of:
   - Drill-down questions (more detail on current topic)
   - Related topics (adjacent areas of interest)
   - Action items (things the user might want to do next)

## Format
Return suggestions as short, natural questions or commands that the user might ask.

## Examples
- "Show me invoices from last month"
- "Which customers have overdue payments?"
- "Create a new deal for [customer]"
- "What's our revenue trend this quarter?"
